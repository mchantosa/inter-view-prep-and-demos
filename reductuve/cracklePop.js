/** GIVEN REQUIREMENTS
 * Write a program that prints out the numbers 1 to 100 (inclusive).
 * If the number is divisible by 3, print Crackle instead of the number.
 * If it's divisible by 5, print Pop.
 * If it's divisible by both 3 and 5, print CracklePop.
 * You can use any language.
*/

/** INTERPRETED REQUIREMENTS
 * Write a program that prints out the numbers 1 to 100 (inclusive).
 * If the number is divisible by 3, print Crackle instead of the number.
 * If it's divisible by 5, print Pop [instead of the number].
 * If it's divisible by both 3 and 5, print CracklePop [instead of Crackle or Pop].
 * You can use any language.

 *    - And not 'CracklePop' INSTEAD of 'Crackle' or 'Pop'
